1	:	id of the device where the file is stored
2	:	file serial number
3	:	permissions
4	:	number of hard links
5	:	owner user name
6	:	owner group name
7	:	rdev id
8	:	file size
9	:	last access time
10	:	last modification time
11	:	last change of status time
12	:	file creation time
13	:	I/O optimal block size
14	:	blocks allocated for the file
15	:	user defined flags for the file
16	:	file name




N.B:
	-	Only character special files and block special files have an st_rdev value. This value contains the device number for the actual device.
	-	The st_dev value for every filename on a system is the device number of [the file system] containing that filename and its corresponding i-node.
mount would be helpful with st_dev.


on the contrary of stat, lstat retries infos about the file itself (not the file the links references to if the file is a symbolik link);
